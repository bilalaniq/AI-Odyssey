# Constraint Satisfaction Techniques & Game AI Design

**Constraint Satisfaction Techniques** are methods used to find solutions to problems defined by a set of **variables**, each with possible **values (domains)**, and a set of **constraints** that specify allowable combinations. These techniques systematically explore or reduce the search space to find valid assignments that satisfy all constraints.

**Constraint Satisfaction Techniques in Game AI Design** involve using **CSP methods** to help game agents make intelligent decisions under specific rules or limitations. These techniques represent problems as **variables**, **domains**, and **constraints** to efficiently find valid solutions.

Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) and Game AI, often taught together in Artificial Intelligence courses because both involve search, constraints, and reasoning.

# **Problem: Map Coloring**

The **Map Coloring Problem** is a classical **AI and CSP example**.

**Description:**

* You must color each region of a map (e.g., Australia’s 7 states: WA, NT, SA, Q, NSW, V, T).
* **Constraint:** No two *neighboring regions* can have the **same color**.
* Usually, you have a small set of available colors (like Red, Green, and Blue).

**Goal:**

Find a coloring such that **all constraints are satisfied** — no two adjacent regions share the same color.


## **Solving Map Coloring using Search Trees**

Before introducing CSPs, we can try solving this as a **state-space search** problem.

**How it works:**

* Each **state** = a partial assignment (e.g., WA = Red, NT = Green, SA = ?)
* The **goal test** = when all regions are colored and no constraints are violated.
* **Search method:** Depth-First Search (DFS).

**Problems with normal search:**

* The algorithm treats each state as a **black box** (atomic, no structure).
* The search cannot “see” why a partial solution is invalid — it only checks at the end.
* It must generate and check **many useless states**, even when an early conflict exists (e.g., two adjacent states already share a color).

Thus, we need a **better representation** — where the algorithm *knows the constraints*.



## **Introducing Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)**

**Idea:**

Instead of exploring blindly, we make **constraints explicit** so we can **prune** impossible states early.

**Definition:**

A CSP consists of:

* **X (Variables):** `{X1, X2, ..., Xn}`
* **D (Domains):** `{D1, D2, ..., Dn}` — each domain Di lists possible values for variable Xi
* **C (Constraints):** A set of restrictions on allowed combinations of variable values

### **Example (Australia Map Coloring):**

* **Variables (X):** `{WA, NT, SA, Q, NSW, V, T}`
* **Domains (D):** `{R, G, B}` for all variables
* **Constraints (C):** `{WA ≠ NT, WA ≠ SA, NT ≠ SA, NT ≠ Q, SA ≠ Q, SA ≠ NSW, SA ≠ V, Q ≠ NSW, NSW ≠ V}`

Now the algorithm can use these constraints directly during the search.

---

































## **4. CSP as a Constraint Graph**

A **Constraint Graph** visually represents the CSP:

* Each **node** = a variable (e.g., WA, NT, SA, etc.)
* Each **edge** = a binary constraint between two variables (e.g., WA ≠ NT)

This helps visualize relationships between variables.

For more complex CSPs (like n-ary constraints), we can use a **Factor Graph**, where:

* Circular nodes = variables
* Square nodes = constraints
* Edges connect each constraint to the variables it involves.

---

## **5. Definitions in CSPs**

| Term                      | Meaning                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Assignment**            | Giving values to one or more variables |
| **Complete Assignment**   | All variables have assigned values     |
| **Partial Assignment**    | Some variables are still unassigned    |
| **Consistent Assignment** | Does not violate any constraint        |
| **Solution**              | A complete and consistent assignment   |
| **Partial Solution**      | A partial but consistent assignment    |

**Example:**
If `WA=Red, NT=Green`, this is a **partial consistent assignment** (no conflict yet).
If later `SA=Red`, but SA neighbors WA (also Red), it becomes **inconsistent**.

---

## **6. Solving Map Coloring Using Backtracking Search**

**Backtracking Search** = Depth-First Search specialized for CSPs.

### **Algorithm Outline:**

1. Start with an empty assignment `{}`.
2. Choose an unassigned variable.
3. Assign a value from its domain.
4. If assignment violates a constraint → **backtrack**.
5. Continue until all variables are assigned.

This is the **basic (uninformed)** CSP solving method.

However, backtracking can still explore many unnecessary states — so we add **heuristics** and **constraint propagation**.

---

## **7. Heuristics in CSP**

Heuristics help decide:

1. **Which variable** to assign next
2. **Which value** to try for that variable

### **7.1 Most Constrained Variable (MRV)**

* Also called **Minimum Remaining Values** heuristic.
* Choose the variable with the **fewest legal values** left.
* If a variable is about to fail, we fail early — saving time.

**Example:**
If SA can only be blue (because its neighbors use red and green), choose SA next.

---

### **7.2 Least Constrained Value (LCV)**

* When assigning a value, choose the one that **leaves the most options** open for others.
* Try to keep future flexibility.

**Example:**
If coloring Q = Red leaves 6 options open for others, but Q = Blue leaves only 4, choose **Red**.

---

## **8. Constraint Propagation**

Even with good heuristics, we can go further by **propagating constraints** — removing inconsistent values from domains before exploring deeper.

---

### **8.1 Forward Checking**

* When a variable gets a value, remove incompatible values from its neighbors’ domains.
* If any neighbor has **no legal values left**, backtrack immediately.

**Effect:** Early detection of conflicts.

**Limitation:**
Forward checking only looks **one step ahead**; it doesn’t catch deeper indirect conflicts.

---

### **8.2 Arc Consistency (AC-3 Algorithm)**

* For each pair (X → Y), ensure:
  *For every value of X, there exists at least one allowed value of Y.*

* If not, remove the inconsistent value from X’s domain.

* If a value is removed, repeat the process for neighboring arcs.

**Advantages:**

* Detects failure earlier than forward checking.
* Can be done **before** or **during** search.
* Greatly reduces search space.

---

## **9. Advantages of CSPs**

1. Can represent **many different problems** (scheduling, puzzles, etc.).
2. Use **general-purpose solvers** — no need for problem-specific code.
3. **Prune large parts of the search space** using constraints.
4. Make **search more efficient** than simple state-space methods.

---

## **10. Adversarial Search Problems (Game AI)**

So far, CSPs involved **one agent** solving a problem.
But in **games**, multiple agents exist — often with **opposing goals**.

### **Definition:**

* **Adversarial search** = search involving **two or more agents** with **conflicting objectives**.
* One player’s gain is another’s loss (**zero-sum**).

**Examples:** Chess, Go, Poker, Tic-Tac-Toe.

### **Why games?**

They are excellent AI testbeds because they have:

* Well-defined **states**, **actions**, and **rules**.
* Require **strategic reasoning** and **decision-making under competition**.

---

## **11. Games as Search Problems**

In Game AI, we model games as **search trees**:

* **State (position):** configuration of the game board.
* **Action (move):** possible step by a player.
* **Transition model:** how actions change the state.
* **Terminal state:** end of game (win, lose, draw).
* **Utility (payoff):** numerical score for each terminal state.

### **Types of Games (AI focus):**

* **Deterministic:** no randomness (e.g., chess)
* **Two-player:** alternating turns
* **Perfect information:** both players know the full state
* **Zero-sum:** one’s gain = other’s loss

These properties make such games ideal for algorithms like **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning**, which evaluate the best move under opposition.

## **2. Map Coloring Problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem**

### **CSP Formulation:**

A CSP is defined by three components:

1. **Variables (X):** the regions → e.g., WA, NT, SA, Q, NSW, V, T
2. **Domains (D):** possible colors for each → e.g., {red, green, blue}
3. **Constraints (C):** adjacent regions must have different colors

   * e.g., (WA ≠ NT), (NT ≠ SA), (SA ≠ NSW), etc.

### **Advantages of CSP Representation:**

* Constraints are **explicitly represented**.
* Specialized CSP algorithms can use:

  * **Constraint propagation** (to eliminate impossible values early)
  * **Heuristics** (to choose variables/values efficiently)

This formalization allows **efficient pruning** and makes problems like Sudoku, timetabling, and scheduling solvable in reasonable time.

---

## **3. Heuristics in CSP**

Heuristics guide search by making **smarter choices** about:

* Which variable to assign next
* Which value to try first

---

### **3.1 Most Constrained Variable (MCV) / Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)**

* **Idea:** Choose the variable with the **fewest legal values left**.
* **Reasoning:** Harder variables should be solved first — if one has no valid options, fail early rather than exploring deeply.
* **Example:** If SA can only be blue (since red and green are used by neighbors), assign SA next.

This heuristic reduces wasted search and detects dead ends early.

---

### **3.2 Least Constrained Value (LCV)**

* **Idea:** When assigning a value, choose the one that **rules out the fewest options** for other variables.
* **Goal:** Keep as many options open as possible for future assignments.
* **Example:** If assigning red to WA removes fewer color options for NT and SA than blue does, choose red.

Combining **MRV (variable choice)** and **LCV (value choice)** greatly improves efficiency.

---

## **4. Constraint Propagation**

Constraint propagation means **using constraints to reduce domains** before or during search — removing values that can’t possibly appear in any valid solution.

It prevents exploring inconsistent states early.

---

### **4.1 Forward Checking**

* After assigning a variable a value, eliminate inconsistent values from **neighboring variables’ domains**.
* If any neighbor has no remaining values, **backtrack immediately**.

**Example:**
If we color WA = Red, we remove “Red” from the domains of NT and SA.

**Effect:**

* Detects conflicts early
* Reduces unnecessary future exploration
* Works dynamically during search

---

### **4.2 Arc Consistency (AC-3 Algorithm)**

* Stronger than forward checking.
* For every pair of connected variables (Xi, Xj), ensure **every value in Xi’s domain** has at least one **compatible value in Xj’s domain**.

If not, remove that value from Xi’s domain.

**Example:**
If (WA, NT) must differ, and NT’s domain = {Red}, then WA’s domain must remove {Red} (because there’s no compatible choice left).

**Algorithm:**
AC-3 repeatedly enforces this condition across all arcs until no more values can be removed.
It ensures **local consistency**, not full solution — but greatly reduces the search space.

---

## **5. Adversarial Games as Search Problems**

### **What Are Adversarial Games?**

Games like chess, checkers, or tic-tac-toe where:

* There are **two or more agents** (players)
* Their goals are **conflicting** — one’s gain is another’s loss
* These are **zero-sum games**.

### **Search Representation:**

* **States:** configurations of the game board
* **Actions:** legal moves
* **Transition model:** how a move changes the state
* **Terminal states:** game over (win, lose, draw)
* **Utility function:** assigns a numeric value (e.g., +1 win, 0 draw, -1 lose)

The AI must search for the **best move**, assuming the opponent plays optimally.

---

## **6. Minimax Algorithm**

### **Concept:**

A fundamental decision rule for adversarial games.

* The AI (MAX) tries to **maximize** its score.
* The opponent (MIN) tries to **minimize** the AI’s score.
* The algorithm explores the **game tree**:

  * MAX levels: choose the **maximum** utility of successor states.
  * MIN levels: choose the **minimum** utility of successor states.

### **Example (Tic-Tac-Toe):**

* Terminal states scored as +1 (win), -1 (lose), 0 (draw)
* The AI explores all possible moves until terminal states and backs up scores.

### **Limitations:**

* The game tree grows **exponentially** with depth.
* Pure minimax becomes infeasible for complex games like chess.

---

## **7. Alpha-Beta Pruning**

### **Purpose:**

Optimizes Minimax by **pruning branches** that cannot possibly influence the final decision.

### **How It Works:**

* Maintain two values:

  * **α (alpha):** best value MAX can guarantee so far
  * **β (beta):** best value MIN can guarantee so far
* During search:

  * If at any point α ≥ β, **stop exploring that branch** — it cannot affect the final choice.

### **Effect:**

* Reduces the number of nodes evaluated (up to half or more)
* Does **not** change the result, only speeds up computation
* Enables AI to search deeper within the same time limits

**Example:**
If one branch already gives MIN a lower score than MAX can accept, there’s no need to check other branches — they’ll be worse for MAX.
