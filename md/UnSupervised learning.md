### Clustering

**Clustering** is an **unsupervised learning method** that groups similar data points together without using labels.

**Key Idea**

* **Similar data → same cluster**
* **Different data → different clusters**

## Types of Clustering

1. [K-means](./K-means%20clustering.md)

   * Groups data into **K clusters**
   * Uses distance from the center
   * Fast and simple

2. [Hierarchical](./Hierarchical%20clustering.md)

   * Creates clusters step by step
   * Forms a tree-like structure


> click [here](./Hierarchical_vs_Kmean.md) to see the difference between Hierarchical vs. K-means clustering 


3. **DBSCAN**

   * Groups points based on density
   * Can detect noise (outliers)
