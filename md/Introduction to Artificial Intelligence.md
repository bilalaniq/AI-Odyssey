**AI (Artificial Intelligence)** is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems or machines capable of performing tasks that normally require **human intelligence**.

In simple terms:

> **AI is when computers think, learn, and make decisions like humans — or at least try to.**

### **Key Abilities of AI**

AI systems can:

1. **Learn** from data (Machine Learning)
2. **Reason** and make decisions (Logic and Planning)
3. **Perceive** the world (Vision, Speech Recognition)
4. **Understand** language (Natural Language Processing)
5. **Act** intelligently (Robotics, Automation)

### **Types of AI**

1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI):**

   * Designed for a specific task.
   * Example: ChatGPT, Google Assistant, facial recognition, spam filters.

2. **General AI (Strong AI):**

   * Would have human-like intelligence, capable of understanding and reasoning across many domains.
   * Still **theoretical** — no true General AI exists yet.

3. **Superintelligent AI:**

   * A future concept where AI surpasses human intelligence.
   * Exists only in theory and science fiction (for now).
